        text: `We love this question! Our online BDE course is the perfect solution for our students. It is self-paced meaning it is available 24/7 and completely flexible around student’s already busy lives.
      Our in-car instruction has always been flexible. We pick up and drop off across the cities we operate in, instructors schedule around the student’s schedules and we work with you to finish the course.
      Now, our theory portion can meet that level of flexibility! The online course fulfills the same content as the traditional classroom course and also contains rigorous testing and comprehension exercises to ensure every student is learning the material.
